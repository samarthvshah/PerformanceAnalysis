# Performance Analysis

The goal of this project is to compile a bunch of scripts that benchmarks the performance of systems. The depend script has the purpose of making sure that all of the necessary files and dependencies are there for all the scripts that could be run. The system_info script simply compiles the system's information about the CPU, Memory, BIOS, etc. The function script tests the functionality of the system by stressing the memory of the system using 2 benchmarks, Multichase and StressAppTest.
